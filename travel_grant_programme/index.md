The State of the Map Organizing Committee provides a Travel Grant Programme (TGP) to facilitate accessibility and diversity at the global SotM 2022 Conference, which will happen in Firenze, Italy, August 19-21. This will be the first in-person OSM global event since the disruptions caused by COVID-19, and while the pandemic is still not over, we hope to bring as many participants together as the funds and health regulations will allow. Given the circumstances, the programme will also dedicate a portion of the budget available to support remote attendance (e.g. by providing access to reliable internet connection) for those who will not be able to travel to Italy because of imposed restrictions, travel costs, or other reasons.

The call for applications to the Travel Grant Programme was opens until May 6, 2022.

<h2 id="for-applicants">For applicants</h2>

This section sets out the benefits of a Travel Grant to attend SotM 2022 and the process and criteria by which applicants will be selected. The TGP is administered by the State of the Map Organizing Committee.

### Travel Grants

The Travel Grant will include a full conference ticket and a lump-sum contribution towards travel, accommodation and other expenses.

There will be 3 different sizes of travel grants available:

| Grant Size | Likely Used For |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| 200 €      | Applicants from Italy |
| 400 €      | Applicants from [Schengen area](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/schengen-borders-and-visa/schengen-visa_en), European Union countries and the UK |
| 800 €      | Applicants from other countries |

The size and number of grants may be adjusted, at the discretion of the Organizing Committee, depending upon the level of funding raised and the number of applications received. Applicants will only be able to apply for one size of travel grant and are encouraged to apply for the smallest grant that will enable them to attend SotM 2022.

Anyone applying for more than one grant will be excluded from the application process.

<h2 id="online">Online Attendance Support Grant</h2>

For those who are interested in attending the conference remotely, but have limited internet connectivity, smaller grants will be made available to subsidize the cost of purchasing mobile data passes. The size of each grant will vary depending on the country and mobile data packages available, but it’s expected to not exceed 50€.

With an estimate of 1GB per hour of streaming videos in HD quality (720p), it’s expected that a maximum of 40GB will be sufficient to cover the entire conference. Arrangements will be made with grant recipients to purchase the data packages directly or to transfer the amount needed via mobile-money.

<h2 id="criteria">Criteria</h2>

In order to guarantee a transparent and fair allocation of funds, the travel grant programme uses a points system for ranking applications. Points are awarded if applicants match specific criteria. After the application phase is over, all applicants are ranked by points, and the applicants with the most points will receive funding.

Please note that the purpose of the travel grant programme is to enhance diversity at the conference. We might reserve a few programme spots for people with unique and outstanding applications. However, the majority of programme spots will solely be determined by the point ranking.

Applicants receive points for the following criteria:

### Nationality

The allocation of points is based on the [World Bank country rating by income](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html).

* Applicants from Low-income economies receive 1.5 points.
* Applicants from Lower-middle-income economies receive 1 point.
* Applicants from Upper-middle-income economies receive 0.5 points.
* Applicants from High-income economies receive 0 points.

### Residence

The allocation of points is based on the [World Bank country rating by income](https://datatopics.worldbank.org/world-development-indicators/the-world-by-income-and-region.html).

* Applicants who are currently living in Lower-middle-income economies receive 1 point.
