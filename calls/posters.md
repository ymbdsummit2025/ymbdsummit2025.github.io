Building on previous State of the Map culture, we love to hear what has been done with OpenStreetMap, but we also love to see more, SotM 2022 invites you to submit a poster today.

Your poster could show how well your home region is mapped; it could be a beautiful new style or map. It might focus on a community project or statistics; it might be a poster explaining and inviting people to OpenStreetMap. What is important is that we want it to be about OSM. We are also welcoming academic posters about research around OpenStreetMap data.

For inspiration, see the posters from previous State of the Maps (e.g. [SotM 2021 posters](https://2021.stateofthemap.org/posters/)).
